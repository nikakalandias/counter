# Basic Counter App


# 01.10.2021

This is my second project in Swift. I know this app is so simple and easy. 
I written maybe 10 lines code but I understand why I written and how I written.
I think so this is more important in programing. 
My plan is in this few days I will add some new command in these app.

Yesterday I written only 10 code lines and tryin to understand logic and algorithm in my app.

And this is worked.

Today I added SecondViewController in my app.(in SVC +5 score increases).
And I added Alert (works when your score is 100).
I feel like I really learned something today, and I realize something;

If I don't quit and continued write code lines (and tryin to understand algorithms) everyday.
I can reach my goals.
Continuity is everything..

Today my 7th day with Swift. I still keep improved my app. Today I added a Timer and a Alert!
You need do your score 10 in 10 seconds, If you can't do this, you see Alert!

I remember when my app is so simple! 

I still progress.
